# abstract-binding-trees

This is an Agda library for abstract binding trees as in Robert
Harper's book Practical Foundations for Programming Languages.  An
abstract binding tree (ABT) is a generic form of abstract syntax tree
that also knows about binders and variables. Thus, this library also
defines substitution on ABTs and provides theorems about substitution.
